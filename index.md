# Deep Learning-based Point Cloud Representation


The scope of this project is the design, development, implementation, and assessment of a DL-based static Point Cloud (PC) compressed representation targeting both decoding and enhancement consumptions.

The DL-based PC representation solutions will simultaneously accommodate compression efficiency and effective PC processing using the same compressed domain stream.

This work was funded by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal) through the research project PTDC/EEI-COM/1125/2021, entitled “Deep Learning-based Point Cloud Representation”.
